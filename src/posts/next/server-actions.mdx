The `'use server'` directive in Next.js is used to create a door between the client and the server, this is called a server action.

`'use server'` is not saying that this is a server component, it is actually saying that the client can use the server to do something, Vercel
probably should have called it `'use action'` or `'use server action'` as this is the actual fucntion of the directive.

Server actions should be used to perform an action, such as:

- Creating a todo item
- Updating a user's profile
- Deleting a comment
- Processing form submissions

<Alert type="warning">
You should think of server actions as a public API that you can call from your client components.

Next JS still leaves authentication and authorization checks up to you. So it is important that you implement these checks in your server actions.

### Don't fetch data with server actions

You should not use server actions to perform a query, such as fetching data from a database. This is because server actions can only run one at a time,
so if you have multiple queries then you're creating a bottleneck, where each query has to wait for the previous one to complete before it can start.

The image above shows a waterfall of queries, where each query has to wait for the previous one to complete before it can start, this is exactly
what happens when you use a server action to fetch data.

### **Understanding** Server Actions

Server actions serve as a bridge for performing server-side operations from client components.

They're particularly valuable when you need to mutate data in your database, process form submissions securely,
or handle any server-side CRUD operations that require authorization or data validation. By keeping these operations on the server,
you maintain better security and data integrity while reducing the amount of sensitive logic exposed to the client.

### Implementation Patterns

There are two main patterns for implementing server actions in Next.js.

The first and most common approach is to define your server actions in a separate file.
This pattern promotes better code organization and reusability.

  lightSrc="/images/blog/sep_light_use_server.svg"
  alt="Diagram showing how use server works in Next.js Here's how you can implement this pattern:"
  size="large"
/>

This is also the reccomended way to use a server action, as it seprates the server logic from the client logic, and helps imrpove
readability and maintainability.

Here's how you can implement this pattern:

```tsx
// action.ts
'use server'
// This code only runs on the server
import { db } from '@/lib/db'

export async function createTodo(title: string) {
  const user = await getCurrentUser()

  // Always validate the user is authenticated
  if (!user.id) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized')
  }

  await db.todo.create({
    data: { title },
  })

  revalidatePath('/') // revalidates the page

  return { success: true }
}
```

```tsx
'use client'

// In a separate file using the server action
import { createTodo } from './action'

export default function TodoForm() {
  return (
    <form action={createTodo}>
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

The second pattern involves defining server actions directly within your server components. This approach can be useful for simpler operations or when the server action is specific to a single component.

Here's an example of this inline pattern:

```tsx
export default function TodoList() {
  async function deleteTodo(formData: FormData) {
    'use server' // Opens a door to the client

    const user = await getCurrentUser()

    if (!user.id) {
      throw new Error('Unauthorized')
    }

    const id = Number(formData.get('id'))
    await db.todo.delete({
      where: { id },
    })
    revalidatePath('/') // revalidates the page

    return { success: true }
  }

  return (
    <form action={deleteTodo}>
      <button type="submit">Delete Todo</button>
    </form>
  )
}
Info
```

Note that server actions can only be created in server components, you cannot add `'use server'` in a client component.

### Building Robust Server Actions

When implementing server actions, it's crucial to build them with security and reliability in mind, as I stated
above, Next JS leaves authentication and authorization checks up to you, so if you have sensitive data that
you want to mutate with a server action, you must do auth checks.

You can perform auth checks very easily by checking that the current user has persmissions to invoke the server action.

Here is a simple example:

```tsx
'use server'

export async function createTodo(formData: FormData) {
  const user = await getCurrentUser() // You would use your own auth logic here

  // Then you would check if the user has the authorization to perform the action
  if (!user.id) throw new Error('Unauthorized') // [!code highlight]

  // Create the todo item in the database
  await db.todo.create({ data: { title, description, completed } })
}
```

By doing this we can gurantee that the currently logged in user is the only one that can
perform this action, if we do not do this step, a user can actually hit this endpoint from something
like postman and perform the action without any authorization checks.

Remember that `'use server'` is a public API, and you MUST treat it as such.

Here is a list of things you should do when implementing server actions:

- Keep actions focused on a single responsibility
- Return only necessary data to minimize exposure
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate input data server-side

Input validation is a critical aspect of server actions. Using a schema validation library like Zod can help ensure your server actions receive and process the expected data format. Here's how you can implement robust validation:

```tsx
'use server'

import { z } from 'zod'

// Define the schema for the input data
const schema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1),
  description: z.string().min(1),
  completed: z.boolean(),
})

export async function createTodo(formData: FormData) {
  // Parse the input data using the schema
  const { title, description, completed } = schema.parse(Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()))

  await db.todo.create({
    // Create the todo item in the database
    data: { title, description, completed },
  })

  return { success: true }
}
```

### Important Considerations

When working with server actions, keep these key points in mind:

- Server actions must be async functions
- Server actions cannot be created in client components
- Server actions can't access client-side APIs
- Each server action call results in a network request
- Always implement proper security checks
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- If you call an API route with a server action, you must use the full path to the route.
