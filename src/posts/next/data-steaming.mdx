Data streaming is a concept in Next JS the allows you to stream data into to the client as it is generated,
this is great for applications that have large dynamic datasets that may take time to load.

With Data steaming you can render all of the static content first, and then stream in the dynamic data whilst
displaying a loading state for that dynamic content, once the data is fully loaded the loading state is
removed and the data is displayed.

## How it works

To understand how data streaming works, we will need to first understand how Server side
Rendering (SSR) works.

### SSR

SSR has a few steps that need to happen before a user is able to see and interact with the
page.

These steps are:

1. The data needs to be fetched from the server
2. The server will then render the HTML for the page
3. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are then sent down to the client
4. A Non-interactive page is then displayed to the user using the HTML, CSS
5. The last step is React Hydrating the page to make it interactive

These steps will block the user from getting to the page until all of the data is fetched
and then afterwards React has finished hydrating the page.

This causes that annoying user experience you've probably come across, where you click on a link
and the page is either a blank white screen or its just hanging and it feels like nothing is happening.

This is where Streaming comes in to it, Steaming essentially allows you to break down the pages HTML into smaller chuncks
and then stream them in as they are generated.

This means we can actually render the static content almost instantly, whilst the dynamic content is being fetched.

This diagram shows how data streaming works.

Each component is broken down into it's own request from the server.

The first request in this diagram is the static content, you can see it is not fetching data from the server and is more than twice as
fast as the next request.

When data is streamed, multiple requests happen in parallel rather than sequentially.

The total loading time depends on the size of each individual data chunk being streamed, not on waiting for previous requests to complete.

</Alert>

Data streaming uses the `<Suspense>` component from React to wrap the dynamic content, Suspense then gives us
a fallback UI which can be anything you like, but is typically a loading spinner or skeleton UI.

In this diagram above, you can see that we are representing a dashboard and in this case there is a circle component
, you could think of this as a profile picture where the picutre itself is being fetched from an API or Database,
the grey circle is the fallback UI and the blue circle is the data that is being streamed in.

Similairly with the content at the bottom of the diagram, in this section each component is being streamed in
separately, and the loading state is displayed until the data is fully loaded.

The rest of the componets are static and so they are loaded instantly for the user.

Here is an example of how you can implement data streaming in your application:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <ProfilePicture />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Content />
      </Suspense>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

An important thing to understand is that the data being called must be called inside of the wrapped `<Suspense>` component.

For example inside of `ProfilePicture` above you would see:

```tsx
export default async function ProfilePicture() {
  const profilePicture = await fetchProfilePicture()
  return <Image src={profilePicture} alt="Profile Picture" />
}
```

    If you fetch data above the `<Suspense>` component and pass it in as a prop, it will not be streamed,
    and you will not get the loading UI or that instant feedback for your users.

    **Don't do this:**


    ```tsx
    export default function Dashboard() {
        const profilePicture = await fetchProfilePicture()
        return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <ProfilePicture profilePicture={profilePicture} />
        </Suspense>
      )
    }
    ```

The reason this doesn't work is because the data is being fetched before the `<Suspense>` component.
The data must be feteched within the component so that Suspense can handle the loading state.

## Pitfalls

- Data streaming is only supported in the App Router
- Data streaming is a server side only feature, you can't use it in client components

## Conclusion

Data streaming is a great way to improve the user experience of your application, by streaming in the data as it is generated
you can provide a much more instant feedback to your users.

It is a powerful feature and one that you should be using in your application.
