`use cache` is a new directive in Next JS that allows you
to designate components or functions to be cahced.

<Alert type="info">

`use cache` is only available in the carnary build in the app router. You can upgrade to the caranry
build by going to this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/canary) and following
the instructions.

</Alert>

Like all other directives in Next JS, `use cache` needs to be placed at the top of the file, or like `use server` it can also be placed
at the top of a function.

Unlike `use server` and `use client`, `use cache` is not a React directive, and it is specific to Next JS.

As of right now you need to update your `next.config.js` file to use `use cache`.

To do this you need to add the following to your `next.config.js` file:

```ts
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    useCache: true,
    // You can also set dynamicIO which will also enable use cache
    dynamicIO: true,
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

Now that you have enabled `use cache` you can use it in your code like this:

```tsx
// Page level
'use cache'

export default async function Page() {
  // ...
}

// Component level
export async function MyComponent() {
  'use cache'
  return <></>
}

// Function level
export async function getData() {
  'use cache'
  const data = await fetch('/api/data')
  return data
}
```

## Good to know

Any serializable arguments or props passed to the cached function, will be converted to a format like JSON and automatically become a part of the cache key.

When using `use cache`, there are a few important things to understand about how it handles different types of data:

Non-serializable values (like functions or complex objects) that are passed into a cached function will be treated as "black boxes" - they can be passed through but not examined or changed. These values are only resolved when the request actually runs and don't affect the cache key.

Let's look at an example: If you have a cached component that accepts children as a prop, it can render those children (like `<div>{children}</div>`), but it can't look inside or modify the children prop itself.

Any data that your cached function returns needs to be serializable (able to be converted to a simple format like JSON). This is essential for the caching system to work properly.

Keep in mind that cached functions should be "pure" - they shouldn't:

- Change any state
- Directly modify the webpage
- Set up any timers or intervals

When you use Partial Prerendering in Next.js, any parts of your app using `use cache` will be included in the initial static HTML that's generated.

One advantage of `use cache` over the older `unstable_cache` is that it's more flexible - while `unstable_cache` only works with JSON data, `use cache` can handle any serializable data that React can render, including actual rendered components.

## Examples

### Caching routes

You can cache entire routes by using `use cache` in both layout and page files.

```tsx
'use cache'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

Any components imported into the page or layout will inherit the caching behavior of the parent.

```tsx
'use cache'

async function Posts() {
  const posts = await fetch('/api/posts')
  // loop through posts
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Posts /> {/*  Posts will be cached */}
    </main>
  )
}
```

### Caching components

You can cache components by using the `use cache` directive in a component file.

Then you can reuse this component and as long as the props contain the same structure and are serializable, the component
will share the cache entry.

```tsx
'use cache'

function ProductCard({ product }: { product: { name: string; price: number } }) {
  return <div>{product.name}</div>
}

export default function Page() {
  return <ProductCard product={{ name: 'Product 1', price: 100 }} />
}
```

## Revalidating cache

Next JS will by default set a revalidation time of 15 minutes when you use the `use cache` directive.

If you want to change this behaviour you use:

- cacheLife: For time-based revalidation
- cacheTag: for on-demand revalidation

Both of these APIs intergrate across both the client and server caching layers, which means if you configure these they will be
applied everywhere.

## Conclusion

`use cache` is a new directive in Next JS that allows you to cache your components and routes.

This is a significant step forward in caching in Next JS, and adds a super nice DX for working with cache.
