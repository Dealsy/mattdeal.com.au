Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze.

```tsx
// Example Next.js page component
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js</h1>
      <p>Let's build something amazing!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key features out of the box:

1. File-based routing
2. Server-side rendering
3. API routes
4. Built-in optimizations
